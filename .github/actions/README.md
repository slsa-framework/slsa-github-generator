# Internal Action Development

## External Actions

The following Actions:

- detect-workflow
- privacy-check
- rng
- secure-builder-checkout
- generate-builder

are considered "external" even though they are hosted on the same repository: they are not called via:

`././github/actions/name`

but instead via their "fully-qualified" name:

`slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator/.github/actions/name@vX.Y.Z`.

We do this because the Actions are part of the builder, whereas the workflow runs in the "context" of the calling repository.

These Action _MUST_ be pinned with the release tag for consistency.

## Internal Actions

Other Actions are called via:

`././github/actions/name`

and always require a checkout of the builder repository before being called.
The `secure-builder-checkout` is always used to checkout the builder repository
at `__BUILDER_CHECKOUT_DIR__` location. The `secure-project-checkout-*` checkout
the project to build at the location `__PROJECT_CHECKOUT_DIR__`.

These Actions are _composite actions_. They invoke scripts and also call other Actions.

## Development

To create or update an internal Action, reference them at `@main`. For a release, reference them at the release tag.

1. Create / modify the Action under `./github/actions/<your-action>` and get the changes merged. Let's call the resulting
   commit hash after merge `CH`. (Note: This won't affect any workflow's behavior since
   the existing code will still be calling the Action at an older commit hash).

2. Update the re-usable workflow / Actions to use them in a follow-up PR:

```yaml
uses: slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator/.github/actions/<your-action>@<CH>
```

You can update using the following command:

```shell
find .github/ -name '*.yaml' -o -name '*.yml' | xargs sed -i 's/uses: slsa-framework\/slsa-github-generator\/\.github\/actions\/\(.*\)@[a-f0-9]*/uses: slsa-framework\/slsa-github-generator\/.github\/actions\/\1@_YOUR_CH__/'
```

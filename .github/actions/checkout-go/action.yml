    # Note: we could use a single block:
    #  `uses: actions/checkout
    #     with:
    #       ref: "${{ inputs.ref }}"`
    # and it would work, because the ref field does not have a default
    # value set https://github.com/actions/checkout/blob/main/action.yml#L7-L11.
    # However, if this were to change in the future, we'd be setting an empty value
    # when the developer has not defined it; and it would overwrite the default value
    # set by the `actions/checkout`. Even if it is highly unlikely the `actions/checkout` team
    # will set a default value in the future, we want to be sure it does not affect us if they do.
    # This is why we use 2 blocks to call the `actions/checkout`:
    #   1. if inputs.ref != ''
    #   2. if inputs.ref == ''

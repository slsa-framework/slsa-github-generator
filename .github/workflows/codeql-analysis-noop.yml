# For most projects, this workflow file will not need changing; you simply need
# to commit it to your repository.

# You may wish to alter this file to override the set of languages analyzed,
# or to provide custom queries or build logic.

# ******** NOTE ********
# This workflow implements the CodeQL / Analyze job as a no-op for docs and
# coniguration updates (.md and .yml files) in order to satisfy the required
# CodeQL / Analyze status check.
# See https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests/troubleshooting-required-status-checks#handling-skipped-but-required-checks

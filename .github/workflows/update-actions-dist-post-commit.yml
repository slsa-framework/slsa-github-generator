# A workflow to run against renovate-bot's PRs,
# such as `make package` after it updates the package.json and package-lock.json files.

# The potentially untrusted code is first run inside a low-privilege Job, and the diff is uploaded as an artifact.
# Then a higher-privilege Job applies the diff and pushes the changes to the PR.
# It's important to only run this workflow against PRs from trusted sources, after also reviewing the changes!

# There have been vulnerabilities with using `git apply` https://github.blog/2023-04-25-git-security-vulnerabilities-announced-4/
# At this point a compromised git binary cannot modify any of this repo's branches, only the PR fork's branch,
# due to our branch protection rules and CODEOWNERS.
# It aslso cannot submit a new release or modify exsiting releases due to tag protection rules.

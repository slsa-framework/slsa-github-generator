# Generation of SLSA3+ provenance for native GitHub projects

This repository contains the implementation for generating non-forgeable [SLSA provenance](https://slsa.dev/) that meets the requirement for the [SLSA level 3 and above](https://slsa.dev/spec/v0.1/levels). The SLSA generation makes use of a [Github Actions reusable workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows).

This repository contains the code, examples and technical design for the blog post on [Non forgeable SLSA provenance using GitHub workflows](https://security.googleblog.com/2022/04/improving-software-supply-chain.html).

## Overview

This repository contains free tools to generate and verify SLSA Build Level 3 provenance for native GitHub projects using GitHub Actions.
Developers can build their software using a secure process that protects against many supply chain attacks and tampering.
Users of their software can verify a tamper-proof statement of the process to know how the software was created.

### What is SLSA?

[Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts](https://slsa.dev), or SLSA (salsa),
is a security framework, a checklist of standards and controls to prevent
tampering, improve integrity, and secure packages and infrastructure in your
projects, businesses or enterprises.

SLSA defines an incrementally adoptable set of levels which are defined in
terms of increasing compliance and assurance. SLSA levels are like a common
language to talk about how secure software, supply chains and their component
parts really are.

### What is provenance?

Provenance is information, or metadata, about how a software artifact was
created. This could include information about what source code, build system,
and build steps were used, as well as who and why the build was initiated.
Provenance can be used to determine the authenticity and trustworthiness of
software artifacts that you use.

As part of the framework, SLSA defines a
[provenance format](https://slsa.dev/provenance/) which can be used to hold this
metadata.

### What is slsa-github-generator?

slsa-github-generator is a set of tools for generation of SLSA3+ provenance for
native GitHub projects. It allows projects to generate
[SLSA provenance](https://slsa.dev/provenance/) safely and accurately using
[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

Specifically, this repository contains:

- tools for generating non-forgeable SLSA provenance on GitHub for your
  projects. The generated provenance meets the
  [provenance generation](https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/requirements#provenance-generation) and
  [isolation](https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/requirements#isolation-strength)
  requirements for
  [SLSA Build level 3 and above](https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/levels). See some
  [popular projects](#hall-of-fame) generating provenance using this project.
- tools for building a SLSA builder on GitHub using the
  [Build-Your-Own-Builder](#build-your-own-builder) framework. With this
  framework, you can "wrap" an existing GitHub Action into a SLSA builder. The
  SLSA builder will generate non-forgeable provenance meeting the
  [provenance generation](https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/requirements#provenance-generation) and
  [isolation](https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/requirements#isolation-strength)
  requirements for
  [SLSA Build level 3 and above](https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/levels). See some
  [builders](#builder-creation) created using the BYOB framework.

While slsa-github-generator can help you achieve SLSA Build level 3, use of the provided
[GitHub Actions reusable workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows)
alone is not sufficient to meet all of the requirements at SLSA Build level 3.
Specifically, these workflows do not address provenance
[distribution](https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/distributing-provenance) or
[verification](https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/verifying-artifacts).
You can use the [slsa-verifier](#verify-provenance) to verify the provenance.

#### Builder Creation

Several builders have been built using the ["Build Your Own Builder" (BYOB) framework](#build-your-own-builder):

1. [nodejs builder](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator/tree/main/internal/builders/nodejs#readme), by [@ianlewis](https://github.com/ianlewis)
2. [JReleaser builder](https://github.com/jreleaser/release-action/tree/java#slsa-builder), by [@aalmiray](https://github.com/aalmiray)
3. [Maven builder](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator/blob/main/internal/builders/maven/README.md), by [@AdamKorcz](https://github.com/AdamKorcz)
4. [Gradle builder](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator/tree/main/internal/builders/gradle/README.md), by [@AdamKorcz](https://github.com/AdamKorcz)
5. **Coming soon!** [Bazel builder](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator/tree/main/internal/builders/bazel/README.md), by [@enteraga6](https://github.com/enteraga6)

## Generate provenance

Below we describe the various [builders](#builders) and [generators](#generators) in this repository. They build and / or generate non-forgeable provenance
using a trusted / isolated re-usable workflow. You can read up on the design in our [technical design document](#technical-design).

To select the right option to generate provenance for your use case, take into account the programming language and build toolchain you already use, e.g. `go`, `mvn`, `bazel`, etc. Select a [builder](#builders) for your ecosystem.
For example, if you use Go, use the [Go builder](internal/builders/go/README.md). If you use Java and build Maven packages, use the [Maven builder](internal/builders/maven/README.md), and so on.
If your release scripts are more complex than what the builder supports; or if there is no builder for your ecosystem, use a provenance [generator](#generators) instead.

### Referencing SLSA builders and generators

At present, the GitHub Actions provided in this repository as builders and generators **MUST** be referenced
by tag in order for the `slsa-verifier` to be able to verify the ref of the trusted builder/generator's
reusable workflow. It also needs to be referred as `@vX.Y.Z`, because the build will fail if you reference it via a shorter tag like `@vX.Y` or `@vX`.

This is contrary to the [GitHub best practice for third-party actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/security-hardening-for-github-actions#using-third-party-actions) which recommends referencing by digest, but intentional due to limits in GitHub Actions.
The desire to be able to verify reusable workflows pinned by hash, and the reasons for the current status, are tracked as [Issue #12](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-verifier/issues/12) in the slsa-verifier project.

For guidance on how to configure renovate see [RENOVATE.md](RENOVATE.md).

### Builders

Builders build and generate provenance. They let you meet the
[provenance generation](https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/requirements#provenance-generation) and
[isolation strength](https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/requirements#isolation-strength)
requirements for [SLSA Build level 3 and above](https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/levels).

This repository hosts the following builders:

If none of these options fit your needs, use a [generator](#generators) as described below:

### Generators

Generators only generate provenance for you. They let you meet the
[provenance generation](https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/requirements#provenance-generation) and
[isolation strength](https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/requirements#isolation-strength)
requirements for [SLSA Build level 3 and above](https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/levels).

Generators create an attestation to a software artifact coming from your repository.

This repository hosts the following generators:

| Artifact type                       | Generator                                                    | Description                                                                                                                                              | Status                                                                                     |

## Verify provenance

To verify provenance created by any of the builders in this repository, use the [github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-verifier](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-verifier) project.

### Installation

To install the verifier, see [slsa-framework/slsa-verifier#installation](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-verifier#installation).

### Inputs

The inputs of the verifier are described in [slsa-framework/slsa-verifier#available-options](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-verifier#available-options).

### Command line examples

A command line example is provided in [slsa-framework/slsa-verifier#example](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-verifier#example).

## Known Issues

### error updating to TUF remote mirror: invalid

This will occur when generating provenance with all builders and generators.

**Affected versions:** all versions up and including v1.9.0

```shell
error updating to TUF remote mirror: invalid
```

This issue is tracked by [issue #3350](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator/issues/3350). You _must_ update to v1.10.0 to fix this issue.

## Build Your Own Builder

Use the [BYOB framework](BYOB.md) to create your own SLSA builder on GitHub. If you have an existing GitHub Action, you can use the BYOB framework to wrap it into a SLSA builder.
This will harden the build process by running the Action in an isolated environment. Generated artifacts will meet Build Level 3 expectations and produce Build Level 3 provenance.
To verify the provenance, your users can use the [slsa-verifier](#verification-of-provenance).

## Project Roadmap

The project roadmap is tracked via milestones. You can track progress and open
issues via the [milestones page](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open).
Each milestone includes a description of what is being worked on and a rough
timeline for completion.

## Technical design

The initial technical design was described in the blog post
"[Improving software supply chain security with tamper-proof builds](https://security.googleblog.com/2022/04/improving-software-supply-chain.html)".

### Specifications

For a more in-depth technical dive, read the [SPECIFICATIONS.md](./SPECIFICATIONS.md).

### Provenance format

The format of the provenance is available in [PROVENANCE_FORMAT.md](./PROVENANCE_FORMAT.md).

# Generation of SLSA3+ provenance for arbitrary projects

This document explains how to generate SLSA provenance for projects for which
there is no language or ecosystem specific builder available.

This can be done by adding an additional step to your existing Github Actions
workflow to call a [reusable
workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows)
to generate generic SLSA provenance. We'll call this workflow the "generic
workflow" from now on.

The generic workflow differs from ecosystem specific builders (like the [Go
builder](../go)) which build the artifacts as well as generate provenance. This
project simply generates provenance as a separate step in an existing workflow.

## Project Status

This project is currently under active development. The API could change while
approaching an initial release.

## Benefits of Provenance

Using the generic workflow will generate a non-forgeable attestation to the
artifacts' digests using the identity of the GitHub workflow. This can be used
to create a positive attestation to a software artifact coming from your
repository.

That means that once your users verify the artifacts they have downloaded they
can be sure that the artifacts were created by your repository's workflow and
haven't been tampered with.

## Generating Provenance

The generic workflow uses a GitHub Actions reusable workflow to generate the
provenance.

### Getting Started

To get started, you will need to add some steps to your current workflow. We
will assume you have an existing GitHub Actions workflow to build your project.

Add a step to your workflow after you have built your project to generate a
sha256 hash of your artifacts and base64 encode it.

Assuming you have a binary called `binary-linux-amd64` you can use the
`sha256sum` and `base64` commands to create the digest. Here we use the `-w0` to
output the encoded data on one line and make it easier to use as a GitHub Actions
output:

```shell
$ sha256sum artifact1 artifact2 ... | base64 -w0
```

This workflow expects the `base64-subjects` input to decode to a string conforming to the expected output of the `sha256sum` command. Specifically, the decoded output is expected to be comprised of a hash value followed by a space followed by the artifact name.

After you have encoded your digest, add a new job to call the reusable workflow.

```yaml
provenance:
  permissions:
    actions: read # Needed for detection of GitHub Actions environment.
    id-token: write # Needed for provenance signing and ID
    contents: read # Needed for API access
  uses: slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator/.github/workflows/generator_generic_slsa3.yml@v1.2.0
  with:
    base64-subjects: "${{ needs.build.outputs.hashes }}"
```

**Note**: Make sure that you reference the generator with a semantic version of the form `@vX.Y.Z`. The build will fail
if you reference it via a shorter tag like `@vX.Y` or `@vX`.

Here's an example of what it might look like all together.

```yaml
jobs:
  # This step builds our artifacts, uploads them to the workflow run, and
  # outputs their digest.
  build:
    outputs:
      hashes: ${{ steps.hash.outputs.hashes }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Build artifacts
        run: |
          # These are some amazing artifacts.
          echo "foo" > artifact1
          echo "bar" > artifact2

      - name: Generate hashes
        shell: bash
        id: hash
        run: |
          # sha256sum generates sha256 hash for all artifacts.
          # base64 -w0 encodes to base64 and outputs on a single line.
          # sha256sum artifact1 artifact2 ... | base64 -w0
          echo "::set-output name=hashes::$(sha256sum artifact1 artifact2 | base64 -w0)"

### Supported Triggers

The following [GitHub trigger events](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows) are fully supported and tested:

- `schedule`
- `push` (including new tags)
- `release`
- Manual run via `workflow_dispatch`

However, in practice, most triggers should work with the exception of
`pull_request`. If you would like support for `pull_request`, please tell us
about your use case on [issue #358](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator/issues/358). If
you have an issue with any other triggers please submit a [new
issue](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator/issues/new/choose).

### Workflow Inputs

The [generic workflow](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator/blob/main/.github/workflows/generator_generic_slsa3.yml) accepts the following inputs:


| Name              | Required | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ----------------- | -------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `base64-subjects` | yes      |         | Artifact(s) for which to generate provenance, formatted the same as the output of sha256sum (SHA256 NAME\n[...]) and base64 encoded. The encoded value should decode to, for example: `90f3f7d6c862883ab9d856563a81ea6466eb1123b55bff11198b4ed0030cac86 foo.zip` |
| `upload-assets`   | no       | false   | If true provenance is uploaded to a GitHub release for new tags.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |


### Workflow Outputs

The [generic workflow](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator/blob/main/.github/workflows/generator_generic_slsa3.yml) produces the following outputs:

| Name               | Description                                |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `attestation-name` | The artifact name of the signed provenance |

### Provenance Format

The project generates SLSA provenance with the following values.

| Name                         | Value                                                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

generate SLSA3 provenance by updating your existing workflow with the 4 steps indicated in the workflow below:

```yaml
jobs:
  goreleaser:

    #
    # Step 1: Declare an `outputs` for the GoReleaser job.
    #
    # =================================================
    outputs:
      hashes: ${{ steps.hash.outputs.hashes }}

    [...]

    steps:

          # Step 3: Copy the binaries from `bazel-bin` path (i.e.,
          #         Bazel sandbox) to the root of the repository
          #         for easier reference (this makes it easier to
          #         upload these to the release too!).
          #

### Provenance for Rust

If you use [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) to generate your artifacts, you can
easily generate SLSA3 provenance by updating your existing workflow with the 4
steps indicated in the workflow below:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    # ==================================================
    #
    # Step 1: Declare an `outputs` for the hashes.
    #
    # ==================================================
    outputs:
      hashes: ${{ steps.hash.outputs.hashes }}

    [...]

    steps:
      [...]
      - name: Build using cargo
        # =================================================
        #
        # Step 2: Add an `id: build` field
        #         to your build step.
        #
        # =================================================
        id: build
        run: |
          # Your normal build workflow targets here.
          cargo build --release

          cp target/release/target_binary .

      # ========================================================
      #
      # Step 4: Add a step to generate the provenance subjects
      #         as shown below. Update the sha256 sum arguments
      #         to include all binaries that you generate
      #         provenance for.
      #
      # ========================================================
      - name: Generate subject
        id: hash
        run: |
          set -euo pipefail

          echo "::set-output name=hashes::$(sha256sum target_binary | base64 -w0)"

  # =========================================================
  #
  # Step 5: Call the generic workflow to generate provenance
  #         by declaring the job below.
  #
  # =========================================================
  provenance:
    needs: [build]
    permissions:
      actions: read   # To read the workflow path.
      id-token: write # To sign the provenance.
      contents: write # To add assets to a release.
    uses: slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator/.github/workflows/generator_generic_slsa3.yml@v1.2.0
